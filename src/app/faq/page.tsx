      question: "What is escrow?",
      answer: "Escrow is a financial arrangement where funds are held by a neutral third party (in our case, a smart contract) until both parties fulfill their obligations. The money is locked and only released when both the payer and recipient agree."
    },
    {
      question: "Who pays the 1.99% fee?",
      answer: "The recipient does. When funds are released, the recipient receives 98.01% of the total amount, and escrowhaven takes 1.99% as a platform fee."
    },
    {
      question: "How long do card payments take?",
      answer: "Typically minutes after approval. Once both parties approve the release, the smart contract automatically sends funds to the recipient's wallet, which can then be withdrawn to their bank account."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if there's a dispute?",
      answer: "Funds stay locked in the escrow vault until both parties agree. Arbitration features are coming soon to help resolve disputes fairly when parties can't reach an agreement."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a crypto wallet?",
      answer: "No! We handle all the blockchain complexity for you. You can pay with your credit card and receive funds to your bank account."
    },
    {
      question: "Which countries are supported?",
      answer: "We support instant payouts to over 100 countries through our partner Transak. Contact us to check if your country is supported."
    },
    {
      question: "Is escrowhaven secure?",
      answer: "Yes. All funds are held in audited smart contracts on the blockchain. We never have access to your money - only you and your counterparty can release funds through mutual agreement."
    },
    {
      question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
      answer: "We accept all major credit cards, debit cards, bank transfers, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and SEPA transfers through our payment partner Transak."
